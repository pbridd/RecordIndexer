RecordIndexer
=============

A record indexing program for CS240

This record indexing program is on GitHub for portability issues, and also for versioning because it seems
like I change things that break everything only way too often. In a way, it's my way of testing GitHub to see
if it's something that I want/need.

The use of this project, if it goes public, is prohibited for copying if you are in BYU's CS240 class.
